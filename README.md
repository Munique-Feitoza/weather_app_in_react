# Weather app in React

Is an app about meteorology in Brazilian Portuguese. The config.js file is what my code editor app transforms into React, the file isn't poorly organized, it's just that my app doesn't work if they're in a folder, I honestly don't know how to explain why this happened, but in a "lan house" I can't download React, until I find someone place that can do the download I'll produce it this way.

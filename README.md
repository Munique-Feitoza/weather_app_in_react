# Weather app in React.js

Is an app about meteorology. The config.js file is what my code editor app transforms into ReactJS, the file isn't poorly organized, it's just that my app doesn't work if they're in a folder, I honestly don't know how to explain why this happened, but in a "lan house" I can't download ReactJS, until I find someone place that can do the download I'll produce it this way.
